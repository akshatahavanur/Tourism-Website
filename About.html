        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Tourism means travelling to a different place for various purposes. It is the complete activity of travelling
            to a place, for some activity and staying there for some time as required by the purpose of travelling and
            the activity for which you are going for.
            It also gives the opportunity for people to understand the culture, civilization, and religious aspects of a
            country. There are many countries whose main source of revenue is Tourism. It is an export that is not
            visible which earns valuable foreign exchange without any substantial or actual loss of internal resources.
            In conclusion, we can say that tourism is a very productive activity both for the tourist and the
            government. As they support each other simultaneously. Also, the government should consider improving the
            conditions of the country as more and more number of tourist visit their country.
            A stronger economy can lead to positive social effects that impact everyday life. Tourism also creates
            incentives for investments that can have positive social effects. For example, tourism encourages
            infrastructure such as roads, transport networks, medical facilities, and education facilities.
