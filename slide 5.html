    <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India, that historically
      served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort
      on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is
      credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in
      Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions. <br><br>
      Mumbai is a city of contrasts. Arguably India's most cosmopolitan city, it brims with gourmet restaurants,
      five-star hotels, the fancy living quarters of Bollywood megastars, and renowned attractions. But remember: An
      estimated 20 million people call this bustling metropolis home, giving India's largest city a distinctively
      chaotic, energized feel. <br><br>
      The Taj Mahal is an icon of India and one of the top tourist attractions in the world, drawing millions of
      visitors to the city of Agra every year. This breathtaking landmark is every bit as incredible as you've imagined.
      But while most travelers might be eager to escape Agra's pushy touts and exhausting crowds as soon as they've left
      the Taj Mahal, you should consider sticking around a bit longer. <br><br>
      A trip to Amritsar is like striking travel gold. The largest urban area in Punjab, Amritsar is one of India's most
      deeply spiritual cities. Tens of thousands of devout Sikhs and cultural tourists alike make a pilgrimage to
      Amritsar every day for one main reason: A visit to the famous Golden Temple. There's nothing quite like strolling
      around the glistening structure and sitting down for a communal meal from the temple's massive, volunteer-run
      kitchen with dozens of other visitors. <br><br>
      The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue, with a height of 182 metres (597 feet), located near Kevadia in
      the state of Gujarat, India. It depicts Indian statesman and independence activist Vallabhbhai Patel, who was the
      first deputy prime minister and home minister of independent India and an adherent of Mahatma Gandhi. Patel is
      highly respected for his leadership in uniting 562 princely states of India to form the single Union of India. The
      statue is located in Gujarat on the Narmada River in the Kevadiya colony, facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam 100
      kilometres southeast of the city of Vadodara. <br><br>
      The India Gate (formerly known as All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located near the Kartavya path on the
      eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, formerly called Rajpath. <br><br>
      Bandra-Worli Sea Link Connecting Mumbai's main business district to the rest of the city, the Bandra-Worli Sea
      Link makes for a stunning photo backdrop - especially at night.
      Dudhsagar waterfalls are one of the most spectacular natural phenomena in Goa. Water plummets hundreds of feet in
      cascades of large volume, creating a mist all around, giving it a milky white appearance, hence the name. This is
      a popular destination for trekkers and hikers. <br><br>
      Dudhsagar Falls is a four-tiered waterfall located on the Mandovi River in the Indian state of Goa. It is 60 km
      from Panaji by road and is located on the Belgaumâ€“Vasco Da Gama rail route about 46 km east of Madgaon and 80 km
      south of Belgaum. Dudhsagar Falls is amongst India's tallest waterfalls with a height of 310 m (1017 feet) and an
      average width of 30 metres (100 feet).
