    <p>Hong Kong has one of the most impressive and recognizable skylines in the world. The dense collection of
      skyscrapers, both on the island of Hong Kong and in Kowloon, combined with the surrounding mountains and harbor
      set this city apart. In the harbor, traditional red-sailed Chinese junk boats and the historic Star Ferry contrast
      sharply with the backdrop of modern high-rises. At night, the skyline changes character completely as the sky
      darkens and the city lights fill the scene. <br><br>
      Victoria Peak, more commonly known as The Peak. Ride the tram to the top of this scenic viewpoint to see the
      skyscrapers, bustling city, harbor, and surrounding islands. It's best to sit on the right-hand side to get the
      best views on the way up. <br><br>
      The 34-meter-high "Big Buddha" sits above Lantau Island's Po Lin monastery, which was a fairly secluded place
      until the statue was built in 1993. This is one of the largest Buddha statues of its kind in the world and took 12
      years to complete. The size is astounding, both up close and seen from a distance. The setting here is also
      incredible, surrounded by the green forest and views out over the ocean and islands. <br><br>
      The Wong Tai Sin Temple is one of the newest in Hong Kong and also one of the most interesting. Located in
      Kowloon, the original temple was a private structure built in 1920. It was later replaced with a newer building in
      1968. <br><br>
      The Ocean Park theme park has just opened the long-awaited Water World section. This year-round aquatic park has
      27 indoor and outdoor water-based attractions. Park highlights include Torrential River, Cyclone Spin, Tropical
      Twist, Thunder Loop, and Vortex. All include an element of water that either loops you, spins you, or sends you
      careening into a black hole. <br><br>
      For an escape from the city towers to a wide-open space with a bit of culture thrown in, be sure to visit the
      Avenue of Stars. This is where the city pays homage to some of Hong Kong's best-known film stars. Similar to the
      Walk of Fame in Hollywood, the Avenue of Stars is dedicated to Chinese performers. <br><br>
      Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery, located in Sha Tin, offers a beautiful and peaceful escape from the bustle of
      central Hong Kong and a look at the countryside. Set on a hilltop, the main access to the monastery is reached by
      walking up a long and curving set of stairs (approximately 400 steps), lined with hundreds of golden statues.
      <br><br>
      Chi Lin Nunnery Buddhist temple dates to the 1930s but was rebuilt in the 1990s in the traditional Tang Dynasty
      style. The structures are all made of wood, and the large complex is incredibly impressive. In front of the
      complex are carefully sculpted bonsai trees surrounding the Lotus Pond Garden, with several ponds featuring water
      lilies.
