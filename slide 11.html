    <p>A universal symbol of freedom, the Statue of Liberty is America's most familiar icon and the largest statue in
      the world. Standing proudly in New York Harbor, visitors can admire the statue from various points around the
      city, particularly Battery Park, or take a ferry right to the statue. <br><br>
      Grand Canyon incredible natural attraction is one of the most visited places in the United States. Carved out by
      the Colorado River, the Grand Canyon cuts deep into the landscape, creating dramatic cliff walls and ledges.
      Visitors standing on the rim of the canyon can see down to the canyon floor a mile below, and look out over the
      ridges and cliffs that run as far as the eye can see. <br><br>
      Home to the most popular beach in the Hawaiian Islands and possibly the most famous beach in the Pacific, Waikiki
      has been a tourist destination for over a century. Today this area is a cross between tropical paradise and modern
      city. Relaxing on this beautiful stretch of sand with palm trees blowing in the wind will certainly let you know
      you are in the tropics, but the high-rise buildings and busy street in behind are a reminder that you are not far
      from civilization. <br><br>
      Arching across San Francisco Bay, joining San Francisco and Marin County, the Golden Gate Bridge has been a
      California icon since it was built in the 1930s. Contrasting with the blue water, the bridge's orangish-red color
      is an aesthetic accent that brings a unique quality to the city. It also has a unique presence when it's shrouded
      in fog with just the peaks of the main towers projecting through the low-lying cloud. <br><br>
      This famous "Gateway to the West" in St. Louis is both symbolic and eye-catching. Rising above the city, gleaming
      in the midday sun and illuminated at night, the arch can be seen from miles away on the otherwise flat
      surroundings. It was built in the early 1960s and stands in Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Park. <br><br>
      Montana's Glacier National Park offers some of the most beautiful mountain scenery in the United States.
      Mountains, lakes, glaciers, valleys, and waterfalls combine to form a spectacular alpine landscape. One of the
      best ways to truly appreciate the terrain is from the famous Going-to-the-Sun Road. This narrow road, hugging the
      mountain side as it winds its way up and over the 7,747-foot Logan pass, opened in 1932. <br><br>
      Mount Rushmore National Memorial Towering above the surrounding forest are the faces of four US Presidents: George
      Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, and Theodore Roosevelt. This incredible achievement was created by
      one man, John Gutzon de la Mothe Borglum, and upon his death, finished off by his son Lincoln. The hard work of
      carving giant heads out of stone started in 1927 and continued on for many years until its completion in 1941.
      <br><br>
      Boston's Freedom Trail is a 2.5-mile walking route that leads past some of the city's most important historical
      attractions. A line of red bricks, inlaid in the sidewalk marks the route, making it an easy way for tourists to
      find their way around. Information on the trail and the sites can be found at the Visitors Center in the Boston
      Common, which is a good place to start your tour.
