    <p>One of the most significant places to visit in UK in summer is the Big Ben. It is, in fact, the name of the clock
      tower which is located near the Westminster Abbey in central London. The tower, designed by Augustus Pugin, is
      about a hundred metres tall. The place has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is visited by hordes of
      tourists every year waiting to get clicked in front of it. It is one of the most prominent places to visit in
      United Kingdom and is often used by artists all over the world to represent the country. <br><br>
      Think London and the one thing that pops into everyone’s head is this giant Ferris wheel. Located on the river
      Thames, this popular wheel offers a panoramic view of London and its horizons, which makes it a huge favourite
      among tourist places in UK for young couples. The wheel stands at almost 140 metres tall, with 32 capsules at its
      circumference which is how people reach on the top. The place acts like an observation deck and the ride here is
      deemed extremely romantic as well, making it one of the best places to visit in UK for couples. <br><br>
      A treat for all the history buffs, Stonehenge is a Neolithic site – one of the best places to visit in UK with
      kids. The site is close to Amesbury, England and is supposed to date back to 3000 BC. It has been a UNESCO World
      Heritage Site since 1986 and is supposed to have worked as either a burial ground or astronomy site of sorts. The
      beauty of the place lies in the mystery around it as well as no one exactly knows what the stones stand for or
      what its purpose exactly was. However, the place is surrounded by different neolithic burial grounds and
      monuments, which makes it one of the most important places to visit in United Kingdom. <br><br>
      One of the top 5 places to visit in UK, Hyde is one of the four royal parks in London. Located near the Kensington
      Palace, the place was used as a hunting ground in the late 1600’s. Today, it is one of the major parks in the
      country and plays a significant role in the cultural scene of the city. It has become a place to reclaim free
      speech and also is known for holding music concerts from a long list of artists including Queen and Pink Floyd.
      The park is well connected with the famous London tube and the main roads, so reaching here is not a problem at
      all. Picnics here in autumn make it one of the most perfect places to visit in UK in October. <br><br>
      A medieval castle located in Northern Ireland, Dunluce has an old-timey, rugged feel to it, on contrary to other
      forts and palaces in places like London. Located on a cliff, the geography around the castle, with steep falls on
      both sides, might be the reason its first residents chose this place to build a castle on. The place dates back to
      the middle ages and is supposed to built around the late 1600’s. It is the perfect town to spend a weekend in
      winters, making it one of the best places to visit in UK in November. <br><br>
      Located in Manchester, this is one of the most famous places to shop at. Owned by Peel, the place has a number of
      outlets and is a haven for shopaholics, which makes it one of the unusual places to visit UK. However, the place
      is bustling with food joints, cafes and shops and it is just a train ride away, making it one of the best places
      to visit by train in UK. Apart from this, Oxford Street is another significant shopping centre, which is one of
      the best places to visit in UK during Christmas. <br><br>
      This is the place where the British royal family resides, specifically Queen Elizabeth and her husband, Phillip,
      which makes it one of the most significant places to visit in UK for families. The castle located in Berkshire
      represents a long line of the British monarchy and is a piece of art. First built in the 11th century, the place
      has been since then renovated time and again. The castle is built in the Gothic style and has hosted many
      significant political figures of the 21st century like President Obama. <br><br>
      Made entirely of basalt columns, this natural phenomenon is one of the most unique places to visit in UK. Located
      on the shores of Northern Ireland, the place has been declared as a World Heritage Site. It is interesting that
      most these columns here are hexagonal, however, some of them have five, eight, seven or four sides as well. It is
      one of the cheap places to visit in UK as you will be charged no fee to visit the site.
