      Red Square is at the centre of Moscow is one of the most beautiful things to see in Russia. In older Russia, the
      word ‘red’ also meant ‘beautiful’ and hence it got the name Red Square which meant beautiful square. This
      beautiful square houses beautiful cathedrals, museums and government buildings. The place is visited by millions
      of tourists everywhere because of its rich cultural and historic heritage. The must-visit spots in Red Square
      include St. Basil’s Cathedral, Kazan Cathedral, The Iberian Gate, Kremlin Wall, Statue of Minin and Pozharsky,
      Lenin Mausoleum, State Hall Museum and City Hall. <br><br>
      Among the most spectacular places to see in Russia, Manpupuner Rocks initially look like the work of aliens (or
      maybe they really are, who knows!), these uniquely shaped pillars would remind one of the Easter Island Heads.
      Nobody knows about its origin, but these seven pillars are nothing short of an enigma. Some say they were formed
      due to some activities of nature, whereas some others say that these were built by ancestors for spiritual
      reasons. Some even consider the place to be a meeting point of the spirits. <br><br>
      One of the most popular and best places to visit in Russia deserves to be on this list. St. Petersburg, similar to
      Red Square, is absolutely a place of architectural beauty. Large parks, magnificent churches, museums, monuments
      and palaces adorn this city. The place also is well-known for hotels, restaurants, pubs as well as exotic dance
      bars. <br><br>
      Similar to most Indian metros, Kazan too is a cosmopolitan destination where people of diverse religions and
      culture co-exist in harmony. Travellers visit Kazan to see the Kazan Kremlin which has been declared as a
      historical site by UNESCO. The major attractions include watchtowers, museums and cathedrals. The popular street
      in Kazan is the pedestrian-friendly Bauman Street, which is lined by restaurants, bookshops, bars and boutiques.
